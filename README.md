# Boid Simulator with ECS

This project is a boid simulator created using the Entity Component System (ECS) in Unity. The simulator is capable of handling up to 50,000 particles with the use of multi-hash mapping, and was created after completing the tutorial "Intro to Data Oriented Tech Stack (DOTS) & ECS in Unity" by GameDev.tv.

The boid simulator follows the basic principles of flocking behavior, including alignment, cohesion, and separation. These behaviors are implemented using ECS, with each boid being represented as an entity in the ECS architecture.

The boid simulator is highly optimized for performance, thanks to the use of ECS and multi-hash mapping. It also features a user-friendly interface, allowing users to easily adjust the parameters of the simulation to achieve different flocking behaviors.

## Installation

To run the boid simulator, simply download the project files and open them in Unity version 2020.3 or later. The project includes all necessary dependencies, and should run smoothly on most systems.

## Usage

To use the boid simulator, simply open the project in Unity and run the simulation. The simulation will automatically generate a flock of boids, which will behave according to the principles of flocking behavior.

Users can adjust the parameters of the simulation to achieve different flocking behaviors. These parameters include boid speed, neighbor distance, and separation distance.
